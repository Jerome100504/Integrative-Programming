1. What are the basic rules of XML you applied in this lab?

Some basic XML rules typically applied include:

XML must have a single root element that contains all other elements.

All elements must have a closing tag (e.g., <name></name>).

Tags are case-sensitive (e.g., <Name> ≠ <name>).

Elements must be properly nested (no overlapping tags).

Attribute values must be quoted (e.g., <student id="1">).

XML must be well-formed, meaning it follows all syntax rules strictly.

2. Why does XML need a single root element?

XML requires a single root element so that:

The entire document is treated as one structured tree.

Parsers can process XML consistently, starting from one top-level node.

All other elements become children of that root, ensuring the document is well-formed.

Without a root element, the document would be ambiguous and unreadable for XML processors.

3. How does XML ensure interoperability?

XML ensures interoperability through:

Standardized syntax — all systems follow the same rules.

Text-based, platform-independent format, readable by any programming language.

Self-descriptive tags, making data easily understood across systems.

Unicode support, allowing global character sets.

Widely supported parsers and tools, ensuring compatibility across platforms.
